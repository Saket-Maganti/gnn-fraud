# Final submission packaging

Execute only after experiments, official baselines, statistics,
external review, citation verification, target-style rebuild, and independent
audit are complete. Resolve the exact conference rules from official sources,
then freeze the candidate commit and require exact-SHA CI success.

Build the anonymous paper/supplement and public source package in a clean room;
validate page limits, fonts, references, figures, tables, claims, licences,
checksums, private paths, identity, provider payload exclusion, overlap
disclosure, and reproducibility artifacts. Keep the data-free source release
separate from restricted evidence. Do not force-push, merge PR #2, publish, or
submit without the user's final explicit approval.

## Inherited non-negotiable controls

Work only in `${COREGRAPH_REPO_ROOT}` on
`codex/coregraph-iclr-buildout-2026`. Begin with read-only Git, authority,
manifest, and frozen-boundary checks; fetch without resetting; stop on an
unexpected branch, divergence, dirty user work, or failed checksum. Never
force-push or merge PR #2.

Use `${COREGRAPH_EVIDENCE_CACHE}` as the canonical RB09v3 authority. Require
the six archive hashes and the 180 member identities in the tracked manifests
to match before reading payload bytes. Do not use the SSD when the local cache
passes. Stream ZIP members; do not permanently extract prediction CSVs. Never
stage archives, predictions, data, checkpoints, credentials, private path maps,
or local runtime logs.

Preserve the 180 role-neutral artifacts, 60 held-out-protocol scenarios, 540
scenario-local bindings, source/target role separation, source-only fitting,
known-label evaluation filters, chronology, dataset identity, and seed-local
pairing. A target artifact may be evaluated only in its scenario-local target
role. Target labels and oracle quantities are forbidden during fitting,
threshold selection, calibration, model selection, or routing.

Run `scripts/coregraph/hash_frozen_assets.py --verify` before and after work and
require `ZERO_TKDE_SCIENTIFIC_DELTAS (249 files)`. Record code, config, data,
archive, member, prediction, environment, and output hashes. Fail closed on
missing or invalid coordinates. Never fabricate metrics, runtime, memory,
citations, CI, completeness, or scientific conclusions. Any new empirical
claim must pass the frozen claim and statistical gates before entering paper
prose.

## Required handoff

Report the exact Git SHA, input and output hashes, commands, completed and failed coordinates, leakage and frozen-boundary status, scientific conclusions permitted by the gate, remaining blockers, and the next separately authorised action.
